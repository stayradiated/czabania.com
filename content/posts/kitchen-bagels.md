Saturday morning. I decided to bake a batch of bagels. This is the second time
I've ever made bagels - the first I tried two different styles: San Francisco
and New York. This time I just made the New York style.

It's really not that difficult to make bagels, though it is time consuming, as
you need to wait a good hour and a half while the dough rises.

I boiled each bagel in water for two minutes on each side - managing four at a
time in the pot.

After boiling, I gave them an egg wash and covered them with poppy seeds.

I was really impressed with how they turned out.
