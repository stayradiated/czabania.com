I changed up my terminal colour scheme today. It's been a while since I've
changed it. A few years ago I created a tool "terminal.sexy" which is still
running - though it seems to have developed some bugs on it's own.

This is what I've got so far:

I went for a walk to the shops today, to pick up some supplies. I was looking
for ALDI - which is a discount supermarket - but ended up walking into Bauhaus
- which is the German equivalent of Bunnings. I wasn't sure how to walk out
without purchasing anything, so I looked around for something to buy so I could
leave. I browsed through a wide range of products including thermometers, paint
brushes and lamps but nothing stood out. I thought the staff might be getting
suspicious because it had been 20 minutes and I'd started walking in circles, so
I just avoided eye contact and walked past the checkout and to the nearest
door as quickly as possible.

I couldn't find ALDI but I did find an organic food store - "denn's Biomarkt".
It was a very nice store with everything lovingly laid out, and the friendly
man at the checkout was one of the jolliest people I had ever seen working in a
supermarket. I paid 2€ ($3.30 NZD) for a carton of oat milk, which isn't bad
considering this store must certainly be on the pricier side - Countdown are
selling a similar milk for $4.19. Groceries in Berlin are so cheap :)

Leaving the Biomarkt I found the entrance to ALDI and had a look inside.
It's like a small messy Pak'n'Save - I had difficulty finding anything I needed
and skipped outside.

The next store I visited was "dm-drogerie markt" - which had a lot of non-food
items available for sale and everything was nicely organized, both items on the
shelves and the aisles themselves. They had a great range of shaving products -
I'm looking to buy some pre-shave cream, but I don't know what the German word
for that is yet...

The fourth supermarket I found was "EDEKA Fiebig". All these stores are right
next to each other. This was the fanciest supermarket I had seen yet,
equivalent to a New World. They also had just about everything I needed, and it
was pretty easy to find my way around.

Other than supermarkets I also visited the Uniqlo in Alexanderplatz.  They get
a decent rep on /r/malefashionadvice, and we don't have them in New Zealand. I
just wanted to buy a scarf (I lost my previous one in a taxi) and they had nice
checkered one on sale for 2.90€. The queue for the checkout was quite long, as
it's quite a popular store. I'm quite prod of myself for understanding when the
woman asked me if I wanted a bag in German, even though I had to reply in
English.

I'm quickly learning how to purchase stuff at a store:

1. Join the queue
2. When it's your turn, greet the cashier with "hallo" or "guten Tag".
3. Wait for them to scan your items
4. Read the total cost from the monitor and give them enough cash to cover it
5. Wait for your change (I haven't figure out how to say "Keep the change" when
   it's only 1 cent - I have a jar full of small change now)
6. They will ask if you want a "kassenzettel" which is the receipt - I usually
   reply "nein bitte".
7. Collect your items, say "danke schön!" and leave
