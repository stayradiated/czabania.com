I woke up a cold this morning - and went out for a walk listening to my 'Sick
Days' mixtape I made the last time I had a cold. I decided to make a new
mixtape for when I was feeling under the weather. It's mainly based around some
artists I have been listening to a lot lately.

*Spotify Playlist:*

When recording onto tape I cut out the end of 'Take My Hand' because it's quite
jarring.
