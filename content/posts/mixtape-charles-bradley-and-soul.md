Today I purchased my third cassette deck from Fred at retrotronics.co.nz. This
one is a Sony TC-K615S and it's an absolute beast of a machine. I chose it because it
it is a 3-head cassette deck, that is in excellent condition and supports bias
calibration. I'll probably write a blog post about it sometime soon.

Anyway, the important thing is that the tapes I record with it sound a lot
better than recordings I have made with my other decks. This means I am going
to go through all the of mixtapes I have created so far and redub them using
this machine. It is a bit of work, but I think it will be worth it.

One of the tapes I am currently re-recording is a collection of songs by
Charles Bradley and a playlist of tracks I've titled 'Soul Mixtape #1'. To be
honest, I don't really know if all of these tracks classify as 'soul' - I just
chose songs that I felt had a similar vibe and worked well together.

For the artwork I had a go at sketching Charles Bradley himself.
