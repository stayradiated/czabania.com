This is a recipe I've been iterating on for dinner for the past couple of
days, and it's quite tasty so I thought it would be worth writing down.

> Cooking time (including prep): around 20 minutes.

## Ingredients

All the amounts are complete estimates, use however much you feel is
appropriate.

- 1 brick of Egg Noodles
- 1 piece of Garlic
- 1 thumb of Ginger
- 1 Small Brown Onion
- 1/2 of a Red Capsicum
- Handful of Sugar Snap Peas
- 1/4 of a head of Broccoli
- 1 Tbsp of Soy Sauce
- 1 Tbsp of Honey

## Method

1. Pour a few cups of water into a wok, and heat on high until boiling.
2. Place the noodles in the boiling water and cook for two minutes.
3. While the noodles are cooking, finely dice up the garlic, ginger and onion.
4. Fork out the cooked noodles into a bowl, and empty the wok.
5. Pour some oil into the wok and fry up the garlic, ginger and onion.
6. While they are cooking, dice up the capsicum and cut the broccoli into small
   florets.
7. Add the rest of the veggies to the pan and continue frying.
8. Pour over the soy sauce and honey, and then immediately toss in the noodles
   on top.
9. Continuously stir the noodles and veggies around so they don't stick to the
   bottom of the work for at least five minutes.
10. Serve into a bowl, and enjoy :)
