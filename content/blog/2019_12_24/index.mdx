I am thinking about deploying a few projects onto the Google Cloud. These
projects will be built on microservices and use
[Turbine](https://github.com/stayradiated/turbine) to communicate with each
other.

Turbine currently supports RabbitMQ and SQS/SNS queues, but it's surprisingly
easy to write a driver for most queues. Google recommends that services use
their own Google Cloud PubSub service, so I spent the afternoon learning how it
worked and wrote a driver for it.

You can check out [the code on
GitHub](https://github.com/stayradiated/turbine/blob/master/packages/turbine-driver-google-cloud-pubsub/src/index.ts)
and install it [from
NPM](https://npmjs.com/package/@stayradiated/turbine-driver-google-cloud-run).
