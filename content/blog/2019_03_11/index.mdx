Song: Dominic Fike - 3 Days.

^ I'm going to figure out some way to embed a music player for these songs at
some point. Or at least a link to Spotify.

Today was a working day. One of things I want to improve at Mish is how we
write stuff down. It's particularly important when you work with a remote team
because someone isn't always around to answer your questions.

After a lot of searching for better Wiki software, I came across [Nikita
Voloboev](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev) and his amazing [Everything I
Know](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) wiki. This is a great resource in
itself, but what struck me was how it's all edited using markdowns files and
git - and then rendered using [GitBook](https://gitbook.com).

I've been trying this out with our own wiki content, which is a bit of a mess.
GitBook makes it pretty simple to get started with a GitHub repo full of
markdown files -- though sometimes the syncing isn't perfect, it sometimes
misses pages, though this might be because I don't fully understand how to use
it yet. The online editor is fantastic, so even without the GitHub integration,
it's miles better than our current editor.

I walked half the way home listening to "The Infinite Monkey Cage". Then it
started raining so I jumped on the M41 bus. I really love the public transport
here. I bought a month long pass, which lets you use any of the buses, trams,
trains or the subway as many times as you like. It makes getting around this
massive city quite painless.
