I had a goal at the start of the year to regularly post to my blog.

I haven't posted to my blog in a while, and every day I don't I feel a little
bit more worse about it, and so I end up just kind of ignoring it more.

But not today.

Completing goals feels good, especially if you keep a checklist and tick items
off when you are done. But that feel good feeling sometimes isn't enough of
incentive to complete your goals.

I find the hardest part to getting stuff done is getting started. The easiest
way to getting started is to pick a goal that is really easy, so easy it's
almost impossible to fail and takes minimal effort.

I call these "Pathetically Achievable Goals".

My Pathetically Achievable Goal for today was to write a blog post simply
titled "Pathetically Achievable Goals". I didn't even require myself to have
any content. Of course, as soon as I started creating the post, suddenly I have
a bunch of ideas on what to write about, and I find myself with a couple
hundred words.

Here are some examples of pathetically achievable goals that I just made up:

If I haven't gone for a run in a while: 

- Put on running shoes, and just leave the house.

If I need to respond to an email that has been sitting in my inbox for the past
week, and I keep avoiding:

- Read the first sentence of the email. 

If I need to write an email to someone, and have been procrastinating:

- Write down in your notebook 3 bullet points about what the email will be
  about.

We will see how well this works out, I hope to keep writing a blog post every
few days.

Other the Easter break I went for a walk with some friends to Teufelsberg, a
man made mountain with an abandoned NSA station which is now covered in
street art. It was a wonderful spring day and walking through the forest felt
magical.
