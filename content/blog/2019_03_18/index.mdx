title: "Wireguard Port Forwarding"

I've been trying to setup Wireguard. It's one of those things where it looks
like it should be quite easy, but if it doesn't work you have no idea why.

I have a computer sitting in our office, and I want to be to access it outside
of our office over the internet. Unfortunately, the office is behind a NAT and
I can't just go exposing ports.

SO, I used DigitalOcean to create an tiny Ubuntu server in the cloud. This
server has a static IP address, and I have control over which ports are
accessible.

My plan is to use Wireguard to create a VPN between the office computer and the
cloud server. Then I can forward traffic from the server to the office, quickly
and securely.

From now on, I will refer to the office computer as the "client" and the
DigitalOcean server as the "server".

## Installing Wireguard 

### Ubuntu

``` bash
add-apt-repository ppa:wireguard/wireguard
apt-get update
apt-get install wireguard-dkms wireguard-tools
```

## Arch Linux

You can also use `systemd-networkd` to configure wireguard, but I think it just
makes it even more complicated.

``` bash
pacman -S wireguard-arch wireguard-tools
```

## Generating private/public keys

You need to do this on both the client and the server.

``` bash
umask 077
cd /etc/wireguard
wg genkey > privatekey
wg pubkey < privatekey > publickey
```

## Configuration

Everything in `<>` is a variable and should be replaced.

### Server

``` cfg
[Interface]
Address = <SERVER_ADDRESS>
PrivateKey = <SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY>
ListenPort = <SERVER_PORT>

[Peer]
PublicKey = <CLIENT_PUBLIC_KEY>
AllowedIPs = <CLIENT_ADDRESS>/32
``` 

### Client

``` cfg
[Interface]
Address = <CLIENT_ADDRESS>
PrivateKey = <CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY>

[Peer]
Endpoint = <SERVER_IP>:<SERVER_PORT>
PublicKey = <SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY>
AllowedIPs = <SERVER_ADDRESS>/32
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```

### Variables

You need to create a new IP address for the client and server. I think this can
be any address that isn't used.

```
- <SERVER_ADDRESS>: 10.11.12.1
- <CLIENT_ADDRESS>: 10.11.12.2
```

These are the private and public keys from the different computers. The
following are ones I have generated just for this article, and should not be
copy/pasted:

```
- <CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY>: OOsIW12TAKkv6yec5gp6nNC3TN53/PyajifXHHz1t08=
- <CLIENT_PUBLIC_KEY>: 8xMY/IkM2pEn4ADjEQM+rQLjSbscg4hrqERNqvXAbyg=
- <SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY>: YGSeVUzy6N0KqcvMeYmE2OJXntJCZOq682WYS6elcm4=
- <SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY>: rczpxKe5VPMrjTPZ13/jwCOYQkZEVzgkVFJPeyK2sn8=
```

Your server should have a static IP. You will also need to pick a port number,
and make sure that it isn't blocked by any firewall.

I like to use
[random.org](https://www.random.org/integers/?num=1&min=5001&max=49151&col=5&base=10&format=html&rnd=new)
to pick port numbers.

```
- <SERVER_IP>: 175.198.17.240
- <SERVER_PORT>: 45776
```

### Example Server Config

``` cfg
[Interface]
Address = 10.11.12.1
PrivateKey = YGSeVUzy6N0KqcvMeYmE2OJXntJCZOq682WYS6elcm4=
ListenPort = 45776

[Peer]
PublicKey = 8xMY/IkM2pEn4ADjEQM+rQLjSbscg4hrqERNqvXAbyg=
AllowedIPs = 10.11.12.2/32
```

### Example Client Config

``` cfg
[Interface]
Address = 10.11.12.2
PrivateKey = OOsIW12TAKkv6yec5gp6nNC3TN53/PyajifXHHz1t08=

[Peer]
Endpoint = 175.198.17.240:45776
PublicKey = rczpxKe5VPMrjTPZ13/jwCOYQkZEVzgkVFJPeyK2sn8=
AllowedIPs = 10.11.12.1/32
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```

## Starting wireguard

``` bash
# start wireguard using our config file
systemctl start wg-quick@wg0

# set wireguard to start automatically at boot
systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
```

## Checking status

``` bash
wg show
```

You should see information about the peer.

```
interface: wg0
  public key: 8xMY/IkM2pEn4ADjEQM+rQLjSbscg4hrqERNqvXAbyg=
  private key: (hidden)
  listening port: 36494

peer: rczpxKe5VPMrjTPZ13/jwCOYQkZEVzgkVFJPeyK2sn8=
  endpoint: 175.198.17.240:45776
  allowed ips: 10.11.12.1/32
  latest handshake: 9 seconds ago
  transfer: 560.43 KiB received, 34.57 KiB sent
  persistent keepalive: every 25 seconds
```

## Pinging

Run this on the client to ping the server.

``` bash
ping 10.11.12.1
```

Run this on the server to ping the client.

``` bash
ping 10.11.12.2
```

## Port Forwarding

Now that we have a connection between the client and the server, we can setup
port forwarding.

This will forward any incoming traffic to the server on $PORT to the client.

I don't really understand how `iptables` works, I just copied this from:
https://golb.hplar.ch/2019/01/expose-server-vpn.html

``` bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

PORT=6379
SERVER_ADDRESS=10.11.12.1
CLIENT_ADDRESS=10.11.12.2

iptables -P FORWARD DROP

iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o wg0 -p tcp --syn --dport ${PORT} -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o wg0 -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -o eth0 -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport ${PORT} -j DNAT --to-destination ${CLIENT_ADDRESS}
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wg0 -p tcp --dport ${PORT} -d ${CLIENT_ADDRESS} -j SNAT --to-source ${SERVER_ADDRESS}
```

### Saving IP Tables

This will persist your iptables rules in case the server restarts.

``` bash
apt install iptables-persistent
```
