For breakfast I tried out a new method of cooking French Toast. It's from Chef
John - creator of the amazing [Food Wishes YouTube
Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/foodwishes).

His recipe [French Toast - The Fancy Brunch Restaurant
Style](https://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2007/09/french-toast-fancy-brunch-restaurant.html)
recommends only lightly frying the bread before toasting in an oven for 12 - 15 minutes.

> The main difference is the bread is sliced thicker, it's soaked in a custard
batter (really, really soaked), and then after being brown slightly in a pan,
it's baked. That is the real secret. The baking cooks the custard inside the
bread and gives it an unbelievable texture. The outside is crisp and golden,
and the contrast between the two is magical. 

As an experiment, I also filmed the process and edited into an 60 second
video. By restricting myself on the time, it forces me to think
about each frame and cut as much as possible.

Editing the video took a lot longer than I expected, but I'm happy with the
result.
