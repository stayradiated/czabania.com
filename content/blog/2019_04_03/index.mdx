I moved into my new apartment on Monday. It's a cute little place - I'm
renting it for a month through Wunderflats. It has a pretty neat kitchen, so
I'm planning to do a lot of cooking while I'm here.

I made pizza for dinner last night, and it turned it really well so I made it
again tonight.  For the bases I've been using this [Homemad Thin-Crust
Pizza](https://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-homemade-thin-crust-pizza-recipes-from-the-kitchn-45499)
recipe, which I really like because it's quick, easy and tastes pretty good.

I didn't have any ingredients so I had to go to supermarket. I wanted to pick
up some all purpose flour, but it was surprisingly difficult to find. The flour
here has a number, such as 405, 550, 812 etc, and I had no idea what it meant.
Luckily I found [this article about how flour works in
Germany](https://www.noordinaryhomestead.com/flour-in-germany-not-as-easy-as-it-seems/)
and decided on Weizenmehl Type 405 - a very fine white flour.

I also needed yeast (BackHefe), as well as some baking paper
(Backpapier-Rolle), some pizza sauce and cheese (Pizza KÃ¤se), as well as some
salt (Salz). There were so many varieties of salt available, such as JodSalz
and TafelSalz and they came in all sorts of packets - I ended up selecting a
container of sea salt (Meersalz).

The recipe I used makes enough dough for two large pizza bases, or four small
pizza bases.

For the topping, I chose to:

1. Drizzle a spoonful of olive oil on and spread it around
2. Place a few dollops of pizza sauce and try to cover as much as possible
3. Generously cover in grated cheese
4. Cut a brown onion in half, and slice thinly. Sparingly place strands of
   onion on top of the cheese
5. Slice or dice up a red capsicum, and place pieces on top without them
   overlapping.

I would then place the pizza in the oven for around 8 minutes, at which point
I added a few leaves of basil, and let it cook few a few more minutes before
taking it out to cool off.

As an added bonus, I now also have a Basil plant in the kitchen. :)
