Trying out a new blog format, where I just jot down notes about what I did
today. It's inspired by [the wonderful blog of Alice
Bartlett](https://alicebartlett.co.uk/).

- I enjoy bumping into friends while walking around town. I used to get really
  anxious if I saw someone I recognised, and would go out of my way to make
  sure they didn't see me. I've since lived in enough cities where I would know
  no-one, so now I enjoy seeing a familiar face and having a chat.

- Trying to pick a city to live in is difficult. I like living in Berlin
  because out of all the cities in Europe, it's where I know the most people. 

- I listened to the latest episode of 99% Invisible, featuring an episode
  of John Green's podcast ["The Anthropocene
  Reviewed"](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/anthropocene-reviewed), where he
  reviews all sorts of things, such as supermakets, comets and the Tacobell
  menu. I like the way John talks about everything. I think about if I could
  write my own review, and what it would be about.

- I've just moved into my own apartment, so I can start cooking again! I'm
  trying out "budgetbytes.com" for recipes, and so far so good. For dinner I
  made [Spicy Coconut Vegetable Stir
  Fry](https://www.budgetbytes.com/spicy-coconut-vegetable-stir-fry/) which was
  quite easy to prepare, and pretty tasty. It also made enough for tomorrow for
  lunch tomorrow. Afterwards I tried to make [Luscious Homemade Lemon
  Curd](https://www.budgetbytes.com/luscious-homemade-lemon-curd/) - which I
  accidentally mixed in the butter with the other ingredients, rather than
  adding the butter later. I hope it still turns out ok - it's currently
  cooling off in the fridge. Tomorrow I  will make [Lemon Berry Yogurt
  Breakfast
  Bowls](https://www.budgetbytes.com/lemon-berry-yogurt-breakfast-bowls/) for
  breakfast.

- When I'm living by myself, I find I have far more free time. I'm trying to
  let myself get bored, instead of turning to HN and Reddit. I think being
  bored is part of the creative process. 
  
- I haven't been keeping track of what I've been up to over the last few
  months, so I am trying to write down daily todo lists. Ticking things off is
  a good feeling.

- I visited a lot of supermarkets trying to find regular Peanut Butter. The
  first three I tried only had Nutella! I eventually visited the fancy
  expensive supermarkrt, which fortunately had "Erdnussbutter" - but just the
  one option. I miss the wide variety of peanut butters available in New
  Zealand, there was a whole section dedicated to them.
