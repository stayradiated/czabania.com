      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a cold for the last couple of days and have been stuck inside with chicken noodle soup, lemon+honey drinks and a nose that doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to stop sneezing - I considered trying for the world record of longest sneezing fit but the current world record is 977 days!
Instead I decided to venture outside for some fresh air, and ended up finding a hidden path to get up the side of Mt Eden and into Tahaki Reserve.</description>

      <description>I quite like cassette tapes - particularly recording mixtapes.
I acquired a 1970&amp;rsquo;s Sony cassette deck earlier this year - I chose this one because of it&amp;rsquo;s gorgeous wooden plinth and top-loading cassette tray.
It plays back fine, and sounds pretty good for it&amp;rsquo;s age.
However, earlier today, the play button stopped working - I physically couldn&amp;rsquo;t depress the switch anymore. I removed the top and bottom covers to reveal the complex inner workings.</description>

      <description>One of my goals for 2017 is to take an instant film photograph every single day.
Yesterday I had lunch at one of my favourite places in Mt Eden - on the actual mountain bit, not the suburb. As I was leaving I captured this photo of myself walking up a hill.
I hung the camera in a nearby tree and set the timer before rushing back to get in position.</description>

      <description>I woke up a cold this morning - and went out for a walk listening to my &amp;lsquo;Sick Days&amp;rsquo; mixtape I made the last time I had a cold. I decided to make a new mixtape for when I was feeling under the weather. It&amp;rsquo;s mainly based around some artists I have been listening to a lot lately.
Spotify Playlist:
 Cassette List:
Side A
 Earl St. Clair - Good Time Yukno - Sonne Portugal.</description>
