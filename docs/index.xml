      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently living out of a small duffel bag, and only have so many pairs of clothes, so I need to wash them all about every 4 days.
Today is washing day.
The Constructa Viva 1000  The AirBnB I am staying in has a washing machine in the bathroom. The Constructa Viva 1000 - a front loader. It&amp;rsquo;s an older machine, the plastic has started to yellow, the window is covered in a brown dust and the soap drawer has something growing inside it.</description>

      <title>Hot Sauce</title>

      <description>This was a bit on the spicy side.  Jacob is a big fan of the YouTube channel Hot Ones - a TV show where celebrities are invited to eat a series of chicken wings dipped in incredibly spicy hot sauce while also being interviewed. The hot sauces start off on the low end, and get increasingly spicier, finishing with the spiciest hot sauce in the world.
The sauces are available for sale online, and Jacob ordered all 10 used on the show.</description>

      <description>Song: Alfie Templeman - Like an Animal.
Walking to the office  This morning at work I continued setting up Gitbook, and migrated all our existing content from Confluence. This was pretty easy with this Confluence to Markdown tool.
The feedback so far has been pretty positive about using Gitbook, and I am keen to get everyone using it as our main wiki. The trouble is it is quite difficult to change something as core as a wiki - it affects everyone in the team.</description>

      <description>Song: Dominic Fike - 3 Days.
^ I&amp;rsquo;m going to figure out some way to embed a music player for these songs at some point. Or at least a link to Spotify.
The second AirBnB cat - Klaus  Today was a working day. One of things I want to improve at Mish is how we write stuff down. It&amp;rsquo;s particularly important when you work with a remote team because someone isn&amp;rsquo;t always around to answer your questions.</description>

      <description>Song: Big Red Machine - Gratitude.
It&amp;#39;s been raining here.  After today I will have been in Berlin for one week.
I packed my bags and checked out of my first AirBnB at 11am, and can check in to my next AirBnB at 3pm.
It&amp;rsquo;s a cold day, but I have my scarf, jersey and jacket so I&amp;rsquo;ll be fine. I can visit a cafe while I pass the time.</description>

      <description>Song: Pete and the Pirates - Think Twice
I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of the band Teleman, and recently discovered their previous band &amp;ldquo;Pete and the Pirates&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to their album &amp;ldquo;Wait, Stop, Begin&amp;rdquo; today. It&amp;rsquo;s quite good, and fit&amp;rsquo;s my mood right now.
The Lounge/Bedroom of my current AirBnB  I changed up my terminal colour scheme today. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve changed it. A few years ago I created a tool &amp;ldquo;terminal.</description>

      <description>Song: Yellow House - Stray
I want to get back into blogging.
I&amp;rsquo;m not too sure what to write about. So I&amp;rsquo;m just going to start with a photo, a song and a samll description of my day.
Overlooking the Landwehrkanal  It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Frauentag&amp;rdquo; in Berlin today &amp;ndash; a new public holiday created because Berlin didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough days off.
I visited Alexanderplatz, most of the shops (all except cafes) were closed.</description>

      <description>Saturday morning. I decided to bake a batch of bagels. This is the second time I&amp;rsquo;ve ever made bagels - the first I tried two different styles: San Francisco and New York. This time I just made the New York style.
Recipe Link: New York Style Bagels
Recipe Link: San Francisco Style Bagels
It&amp;rsquo;s really not that difficult to make bagels, though it is time consuming, as you need to wait a good hour and a half while the dough rises.</description>

      <description>This was a late night cooking experiment. Originally I wanted to make some bagels - but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough flour. A friend suggested I make this Ginger Crunch recipe instead - and it turned out pretty well.

      <title>Mixtape: A Midnight Bolt Of Electricity</title>

      <guid>https://george.czabania.com/posts/mixtape-a-midnight-bolt-of-electricity/</guid>
      <description>Continuing to redub my mixtape collection, today I chose one of my favourite mixes - &amp;ldquo;A Midnight Bolt of Electricity&amp;rdquo; - for times when you just need some banging tunes.
This is the first cassette that I used the calibration feature to set the bias and recording level. I also checked the left/right balance by using a signal generator app to make sure that both channels were equal. The end result is that this is the best sounding cassette I have recorded to date.</description>

      <title>Mixtape: Charles Bradley and Soul</title>

      <description>Today I purchased my third cassette deck from Fred at retrotronics.co.nz. This one is a Sony TC-K615S and it&amp;rsquo;s an absolute beast of a machine. I chose it because it it is a 3-head cassette deck, that is in excellent condition and supports bias calibration. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably write a blog post about it sometime soon.
Anyway, the important thing is that the tapes I record with it sound a lot better than recordings I have made with my other decks.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a cold for the last couple of days and have been stuck inside with chicken noodle soup, lemon+honey drinks and a nose that doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to stop sneezing - I considered trying for the world record of longest sneezing fit but the current world record is 977 days!
Instead I decided to venture outside for some fresh air, and ended up finding a hidden path to get up the side of Mt Eden and into Tahaki Reserve.</description>

      <title>Sony TC-161SD Cassette Deck Repair</title>

      <description>I quite like cassette tapes - particularly recording mixtapes.
I acquired a 1970&amp;rsquo;s Sony cassette deck earlier this year - I chose this one because of it&amp;rsquo;s gorgeous wooden plinth and top-loading cassette tray.
It plays back fine, and sounds pretty good for it&amp;rsquo;s age.
However, earlier today, the play button stopped working - I physically couldn&amp;rsquo;t depress the switch anymore. I removed the top and bottom covers to reveal the complex inner workings.</description>

      <description>One of my goals for 2017 is to take an instant film photograph every single day.
Yesterday I had lunch at one of my favourite places in Mt Eden - on the actual mountain bit, not the suburb. As I was leaving I captured this photo of myself walking up a hill.
I hung the camera in a nearby tree and set the timer before rushing back to get in position.</description>

      <description>I woke up a cold this morning - and went out for a walk listening to my &amp;lsquo;Sick Days&amp;rsquo; mixtape I made the last time I had a cold. I decided to make a new mixtape for when I was feeling under the weather. It&amp;rsquo;s mainly based around some artists I have been listening to a lot lately.
