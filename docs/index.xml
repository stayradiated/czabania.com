      <description>Song: Big Red Machine - Gratitude.
It&amp;#39;s been raining here.  After today I will have been in Berlin for one week.
I packed my bags and checked out of my first AirBnB at 11am, and can check in to my next AirBnB at 3pm.
It&amp;rsquo;s a cold day, but I have my scarf, jersey and jacket so I&amp;rsquo;ll be fine. I can visit a cafe while I pass the time.</description>

      <description>Song: Pete and the Pirates - Think Twice
I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of the band Teleman, and recently discovered their previous band &amp;ldquo;Pete and the Pirates&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to their album &amp;ldquo;Wait, Stop, Begin&amp;rdquo; today. It&amp;rsquo;s quite good, and fit&amp;rsquo;s my mood right now.
The Lounge/Bedroom of my current AirBnB  I changed up my terminal colour scheme today. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve changed it. A few years ago I created a tool &amp;ldquo;terminal.</description>

      <description>Song: Yellow House - Stray
I want to get back into blogging.
I&amp;rsquo;m not too sure what to write about. So I&amp;rsquo;m just going to start with a photo, a song and a samll description of my day.
Overlooking the Landwehrkanal  It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Frauentag&amp;rdquo; in Berlin today &amp;ndash; a new public holiday created because Berlin didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough days off.
I visited Alexanderplatz, most of the shops (all except cafes) were closed.</description>

      <title>Kitchen: Bagels</title>

      <description>Saturday morning. I decided to bake a batch of bagels. This is the second time I&amp;rsquo;ve ever made bagels - the first I tried two different styles: San Francisco and New York. This time I just made the New York style.

It&amp;rsquo;s really not that difficult to make bagels, though it is time consuming, as you need to wait a good hour and a half while the dough rises.</description>

      <description>This was a late night cooking experiment. Originally I wanted to make some bagels - but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough flour. A friend suggested I make this Ginger Crunch recipe instead - and it turned out pretty well.

      <title>Mixtape: A Midnight Bolt Of Electricity</title>

      <description>Continuing to redub my mixtape collection, today I chose one of my favourite mixes - &amp;ldquo;A Midnight Bolt of Electricity&amp;rdquo; - for times when you just need some banging tunes.
This is the first cassette that I used the calibration feature to set the bias and recording level. I also checked the left/right balance by using a signal generator app to make sure that both channels were equal. The end result is that this is the best sounding cassette I have recorded to date.</description>

      <title>Mixtape: Charles Bradley and Soul</title>

      <description>Today I purchased my third cassette deck from Fred at retrotronics.co.nz. This one is a Sony TC-K615S and it&amp;rsquo;s an absolute beast of a machine. I chose it because it it is a 3-head cassette deck, that is in excellent condition and supports bias calibration. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably write a blog post about it sometime soon.
Anyway, the important thing is that the tapes I record with it sound a lot better than recordings I have made with my other decks.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a cold for the last couple of days and have been stuck inside with chicken noodle soup, lemon+honey drinks and a nose that doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to stop sneezing - I considered trying for the world record of longest sneezing fit but the current world record is 977 days!
Instead I decided to venture outside for some fresh air, and ended up finding a hidden path to get up the side of Mt Eden and into Tahaki Reserve.</description>

      <title>Sony TC-161SD Cassette Deck Repair</title>

      <description>I quite like cassette tapes - particularly recording mixtapes.
I acquired a 1970&amp;rsquo;s Sony cassette deck earlier this year - I chose this one because of it&amp;rsquo;s gorgeous wooden plinth and top-loading cassette tray.
It plays back fine, and sounds pretty good for it&amp;rsquo;s age.
However, earlier today, the play button stopped working - I physically couldn&amp;rsquo;t depress the switch anymore. I removed the top and bottom covers to reveal the complex inner workings.</description>

      <description>One of my goals for 2017 is to take an instant film photograph every single day.
Yesterday I had lunch at one of my favourite places in Mt Eden - on the actual mountain bit, not the suburb. As I was leaving I captured this photo of myself walking up a hill.
I hung the camera in a nearby tree and set the timer before rushing back to get in position.</description>

      <description>I woke up a cold this morning - and went out for a walk listening to my &amp;lsquo;Sick Days&amp;rsquo; mixtape I made the last time I had a cold. I decided to make a new mixtape for when I was feeling under the weather. It&amp;rsquo;s mainly based around some artists I have been listening to a lot lately.
