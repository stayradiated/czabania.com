      <description>Trying out a new blog format, where I just jot down notes about what I did today. It&amp;rsquo;s inspired by the wonderful blog of Alice Bartlett.
 I enjoy bumping into friends while walking around town. I used to get really anxious if I saw someone I recognised, and would go out of my way to make sure they didn&amp;rsquo;t see me. I&amp;rsquo;ve since lived in enough cities where I would know no-one, so now I enjoy seeing a familiar face and having a chat.</description>

      <title>Pathetically Achievable Goals</title>

      <description>I had a goal at the start of the year to regularly post to my blog.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted to my blog in a while, and every day I don&amp;rsquo;t I feel a little bit more worse about it, and so I end up just kind of ignoring it more.
But not today.
Completing goals feels good, especially if you keep a checklist and tick items off when you are done.</description>

      <description>I moved into my new apartment on Monday. It&amp;rsquo;s a cute little place - I&amp;rsquo;m renting it for a month through Wunderflats. It has a pretty neat kitchen, so I&amp;rsquo;m planning to do a lot of cooking while I&amp;rsquo;m here.
My new kitchen!  I made pizza for dinner last night, and it turned it really well so I made it again tonight. For the bases I&amp;rsquo;ve been using this Homemad Thin-Crust Pizza recipe, which I really like because it&amp;rsquo;s quick, easy and tastes pretty good.</description>

      <description>I finally bought a pair of running shoes in Berlin today. It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do since I got here nearly a month ago, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never seemed to have the time. Last weekend I made my way to &amp;ldquo;Lunge der Laufladen&amp;rdquo;, but only had 10 minutes before they closed, which wasn&amp;rsquo;t nearly enough time to pick out a pair of shoes. This afternoon I returned just after midday, and tried out several different types of shoe.</description>

      <description>Tomorrow my Vodafone UK prepaid SIM card plan expires. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a shame, because I still have a whopping 15.7 GB of data left on it. I would have liked to have used that data, but unfortunately for some reason I can&amp;rsquo;t tether it to my laptop - which is a show stopper.
I&amp;rsquo;ve done a bit of research looking for the best prepaid plan in Germany. I think ALDI Talk&amp;rsquo;s Paket M is the best plan for me - at 12.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about time recently. We&amp;rsquo;ve got Daylight Saving Time (DST) coming up soon in Germany. On the 31st March at 2am, the clocks jump forward and it&amp;rsquo;s suddenly 3am. We &amp;ldquo;lose&amp;rdquo; an hour.
I don&amp;rsquo;t mind DST. I like to wake up before the crack of dawn, and have my alarm set to 6am. Recently dawn has been sneaking up on me, and this morning the day cracked open at 5:56am.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been living in Schöneberg for the past few days, and really enjoying it. On both Saturday and Sunday I would wake up quite early and go for a morning stroll, enjoying the crisp air and quiet streets.

      <description>On Friday morning I updated one of my favourite libraries: selfupdate. It&amp;rsquo;s open source, and you can find the code at https://github.com/mishguruorg/selfupdate
At Mish, I started this project for use with our &amp;lsquo;autologin&amp;rsquo; devices. These are Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s we have scattered around the world that run a Node.js script. Before &amp;ldquo;selfupdate&amp;rdquo; was a thing, managing this fleet of Pi&amp;rsquo;s was a pain. To install updates, we would have to manually SSH into each device and run the update script.</description>

      <description>This is a recipe I&amp;rsquo;ve been iterating on for dinner for the past couple of days, and it&amp;rsquo;s quite tasty so I thought it would be worth writing down.
One Wok Noodle Stir Fry   Cooking time (including prep): around 20 minutes.
 Ingredients All the amounts are complete estimates, use however much you feel is appropriate.
 1 brick of Egg Noodles 1 piece of Garlic 1 thumb of Ginger 1 Small Brown Onion 1&amp;frasl;2 of a Red Capsicum Handful of Sugar Snap Peas 1&amp;frasl;4 of a head of Broccoli 1 Tbsp of Soy Sauce 1 Tbsp of Honey  Method  Pour a few cups of water into a wok, and heat on high until boiling.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to setup Wireguard. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those things where it looks like it should be quite easy, but if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work you have no idea why.
I have a computer sitting in our office, and I want to be to access it outside of our office over the internet. Unfortunately, the office is behind a NAT and I can&amp;rsquo;t just go exposing ports.
SO, I used DigitalOcean to create an tiny Ubuntu server in the cloud.</description>

      <description>Ingredients  Last night I had dinner at Jacob and Alex&amp;rsquo;s place. Jacob cooked a fantastic Palak Paneer curry, Alex served us some delicious cocktails, and for a desert I made a tasty chai tea.
This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve made Rooibos chai. I wanted to use Rooibos because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain any caffeine. The chai tea turned out so well I thought I better write down the recipe.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I started a new project.
Quick background:
 At Mish Guru we use Github to manage our code. When a developer wants to submit a change, such as adding a feature or fixing a bug, they create a Pull Request (PR). This PR has a title, description of why the change was made and a list of all the files that were edited. Before the PR can be accepted, it must first be reviewed by at least one other member of the team.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently living out of a small duffel bag, and only have so many pairs of clothes, so I need to wash them all about every 4 days.
Today is washing day.
The Constructa Viva 1000  The AirBnB I am staying in has a washing machine in the bathroom. The Constructa Viva 1000 - a front loader. It&amp;rsquo;s an older machine, the plastic has started to yellow, the window is covered in a brown dust and the soap drawer has something growing inside it.</description>

      <description>This was a bit on the spicy side.  Jacob is a big fan of the YouTube channel Hot Ones - a TV show where celebrities are invited to eat a series of chicken wings dipped in incredibly spicy hot sauce while also being interviewed. The hot sauces start off on the low end, and get increasingly spicier, finishing with the spiciest hot sauce in the world.
The sauces are available for sale online, and Jacob ordered all 10 used on the show.</description>

      <description>Song: Alfie Templeman - Like an Animal.
Walking to the office  This morning at work I continued setting up Gitbook, and migrated all our existing content from Confluence. This was pretty easy with this Confluence to Markdown tool.
The feedback so far has been pretty positive about using Gitbook, and I am keen to get everyone using it as our main wiki. The trouble is it is quite difficult to change something as core as a wiki - it affects everyone in the team.</description>

^ I&amp;rsquo;m going to figure out some way to embed a music player for these songs at some point. Or at least a link to Spotify.
The second AirBnB cat - Klaus  Today was a working day. One of things I want to improve at Mish is how we write stuff down. It&amp;rsquo;s particularly important when you work with a remote team because someone isn&amp;rsquo;t always around to answer your questions.</description>

      <description>Song: Big Red Machine - Gratitude.
It&amp;#39;s been raining here.  After today I will have been in Berlin for one week.
I packed my bags and checked out of my first AirBnB at 11am, and can check in to my next AirBnB at 3pm.
It&amp;rsquo;s a cold day, but I have my scarf, jersey and jacket so I&amp;rsquo;ll be fine. I can visit a cafe while I pass the time.</description>

      <description>Song: Pete and the Pirates - Think Twice
I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of the band Teleman, and recently discovered their previous band &amp;ldquo;Pete and the Pirates&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to their album &amp;ldquo;Wait, Stop, Begin&amp;rdquo; today. It&amp;rsquo;s quite good, and fit&amp;rsquo;s my mood right now.
The Lounge/Bedroom of my current AirBnB  I changed up my terminal colour scheme today. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve changed it. A few years ago I created a tool &amp;ldquo;terminal.</description>

      <description>Song: Yellow House - Stray
I want to get back into blogging.
I&amp;rsquo;m not too sure what to write about. So I&amp;rsquo;m just going to start with a photo, a song and a samll description of my day.
Overlooking the Landwehrkanal  It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Frauentag&amp;rdquo; in Berlin today &amp;ndash; a new public holiday created because Berlin didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough days off.
I visited Alexanderplatz, most of the shops (all except cafes) were closed.</description>

      <description>Saturday morning. I decided to bake a batch of bagels. This is the second time I&amp;rsquo;ve ever made bagels - the first I tried two different styles: San Francisco and New York. This time I just made the New York style.

It&amp;rsquo;s really not that difficult to make bagels, though it is time consuming, as you need to wait a good hour and a half while the dough rises.</description>

      <description>Continuing to redub my mixtape collection, today I chose one of my favourite mixes - &amp;ldquo;A Midnight Bolt of Electricity&amp;rdquo; - for times when you just need some banging tunes.
This is the first cassette that I used the calibration feature to set the bias and recording level. I also checked the left/right balance by using a signal generator app to make sure that both channels were equal. The end result is that this is the best sounding cassette I have recorded to date.</description>

      <description>Today I purchased my third cassette deck from Fred at retrotronics.co.nz. This one is a Sony TC-K615S and it&amp;rsquo;s an absolute beast of a machine. I chose it because it it is a 3-head cassette deck, that is in excellent condition and supports bias calibration. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably write a blog post about it sometime soon.
Anyway, the important thing is that the tapes I record with it sound a lot better than recordings I have made with my other decks.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a cold for the last couple of days and have been stuck inside with chicken noodle soup, lemon+honey drinks and a nose that doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to stop sneezing - I considered trying for the world record of longest sneezing fit but the current world record is 977 days!
Instead I decided to venture outside for some fresh air, and ended up finding a hidden path to get up the side of Mt Eden and into Tahaki Reserve.</description>

      <description>I quite like cassette tapes - particularly recording mixtapes.
I acquired a 1970&amp;rsquo;s Sony cassette deck earlier this year - I chose this one because of it&amp;rsquo;s gorgeous wooden plinth and top-loading cassette tray.
It plays back fine, and sounds pretty good for it&amp;rsquo;s age.
However, earlier today, the play button stopped working - I physically couldn&amp;rsquo;t depress the switch anymore. I removed the top and bottom covers to reveal the complex inner workings.</description>

      <description>One of my goals for 2017 is to take an instant film photograph every single day.
Yesterday I had lunch at one of my favourite places in Mt Eden - on the actual mountain bit, not the suburb. As I was leaving I captured this photo of myself walking up a hill.
I hung the camera in a nearby tree and set the timer before rushing back to get in position.</description>

      <description>I woke up a cold this morning - and went out for a walk listening to my &amp;lsquo;Sick Days&amp;rsquo; mixtape I made the last time I had a cold. I decided to make a new mixtape for when I was feeling under the weather. It&amp;rsquo;s mainly based around some artists I have been listening to a lot lately.
