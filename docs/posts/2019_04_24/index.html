      <p>I had a goal at the start of the year to regularly post to my blog.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t posted to my blog in a while, and every day I don&rsquo;t I feel a little
bit more worse about it, and so I end up just kind of ignoring it more.</p>

<p>But not today.</p>

<p>Completing goals feels good, especially if you keep a checklist and tick items
off when you are done. But that feel good feeling sometimes isn&rsquo;t enough of
incentive to complete your goals.</p>

<p>I find the hardest part to getting stuff done is getting started. The easiest
way to getting started is to pick a goal that is really easy, so easy it&rsquo;s
almost impossible to fail and takes minimal effort.</p>

<p>I call these &ldquo;Pathetically Achievable Goals&rdquo;.</p>

<p>My Pathetically Achievable Goal for today was to write a blog post simply
titled &ldquo;Pathetically Achievable Goals&rdquo;. I didn&rsquo;t even require myself to have
any content. Of course, as soon as I started creating the post, suddenly I have
a bunch of ideas on what to write about, and I find myself with a couple
hundred words.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of pathetically achievable goals that I just made up:</p>

<p>If I haven&rsquo;t gone for a run in a while:</p>

<ul>
<li>Put on running shoes, and just leave the house.</li>
</ul>

<p>If I need to respond to an email that has been sitting in my inbox for the past
week, and I keep avoiding:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read the first sentence of the email.</li>
</ul>

<p>If I need to write an email to someone, and have been procrastinating:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write down in your notebook 3 bullet points about what the email will be
about.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will see how well this works out, I hope to keep writing a blog post every
few days.</p>

<p>Other the Easter break I went for a walk with some friends to Teufelsberg, a
man made mountain with an abandoned NSA station which is now covered in
street art. It was a wonderful spring day and walking through the forest felt
magical.</p>
