            Ingredients  Last night I had dinner at Jacob and Alex&rsquo;s place. Jacob cooked a fantastic Palak Paneer curry, Alex served us some delicious cocktails, and for a desert I made a tasty chai tea.
This is the first time I&rsquo;ve made Rooibos chai. I wanted to use Rooibos because it doesn&rsquo;t contain any caffeine. The chai tea turned out so well I thought I better write down the recipe.

            Yesterday I started a new project.
Quick background:
 At Mish Guru we use Github to manage our code. When a developer wants to submit a change, such as adding a feature or fixing a bug, they create a Pull Request (PR). This PR has a title, description of why the change was made and a list of all the files that were edited. Before the PR can be accepted, it must first be reviewed by at least one other member of the team.

            I&rsquo;m currently living out of a small duffel bag, and only have so many pairs of clothes, so I need to wash them all about every 4 days.
Today is washing day.
The Constructa Viva 1000  The AirBnB I am staying in has a washing machine in the bathroom. The Constructa Viva 1000 - a front loader. It&rsquo;s an older machine, the plastic has started to yellow, the window is covered in a brown dust and the soap drawer has something growing inside it.

            This was a bit on the spicy side.  Jacob is a big fan of the YouTube channel Hot Ones - a TV show where celebrities are invited to eat a series of chicken wings dipped in incredibly spicy hot sauce while also being interviewed. The hot sauces start off on the low end, and get increasingly spicier, finishing with the spiciest hot sauce in the world.
The sauces are available for sale online, and Jacob ordered all 10 used on the show.

            Song: Alfie Templeman - Like an Animal.
Walking to the office  This morning at work I continued setting up Gitbook, and migrated all our existing content from Confluence. This was pretty easy with this Confluence to Markdown tool.
The feedback so far has been pretty positive about using Gitbook, and I am keen to get everyone using it as our main wiki. The trouble is it is quite difficult to change something as core as a wiki - it affects everyone in the team.
