            I&rsquo;m currently living out of a small duffel bag, and only have so many pairs of clothes, so I need to wash them all about every 4 days.
Today is washing day.
The Constructa Viva 1000  The AirBnB I am staying in has a washing machine in the bathroom. The Constructa Viva 1000 - a front loader. It&rsquo;s an older machine, the plastic has started to yellow, the window is covered in a brown dust and the soap drawer has something growing inside it.

            This was a bit on the spicy side.  Jacob is a big fan of the YouTube channel Hot Ones - a TV show where celebrities are invited to eat a series of chicken wings dipped in incredibly spicy hot sauce while also being interviewed. The hot sauces start off on the low end, and get increasingly spicier, finishing with the spiciest hot sauce in the world.
The sauces are available for sale online, and Jacob ordered all 10 used on the show.

Walking to the office  This morning at work I continued setting up Gitbook, and migrated all our existing content from Confluence. This was pretty easy with this Confluence to Markdown tool.
The feedback so far has been pretty positive about using Gitbook, and I am keen to get everyone using it as our main wiki. The trouble is it is quite difficult to change something as core as a wiki - it affects everyone in the team.

            Song: Dominic Fike - 3 Days.
^ I&rsquo;m going to figure out some way to embed a music player for these songs at some point. Or at least a link to Spotify.
The second AirBnB cat - Klaus  Today was a working day. One of things I want to improve at Mish is how we write stuff down. It&rsquo;s particularly important when you work with a remote team because someone isn&rsquo;t always around to answer your questions.

            Song: Big Red Machine - Gratitude.
It&#39;s been raining here.  After today I will have been in Berlin for one week.
I packed my bags and checked out of my first AirBnB at 11am, and can check in to my next AirBnB at 3pm.
It&rsquo;s a cold day, but I have my scarf, jersey and jacket so I&rsquo;ll be fine. I can visit a cafe while I pass the time.
