      <p>Song: Pete and the Pirates - Think Twice</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of the band Teleman, and recently discovered their previous band
&ldquo;Pete and the Pirates&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve been listening to their album &ldquo;Wait, Stop, Begin&rdquo;
today. It&rsquo;s quite good, and fit&rsquo;s my mood right now.</p>

<p>I changed up my terminal colour scheme today. It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve
changed it. A few years ago I created a tool &ldquo;terminal.sexy&rdquo; which is still
running - though it seems to have developed some bugs on it&rsquo;s own.</p>

<p>This is what I&rsquo;ve got so far:</p>


  <img src="/img/colorscheme.jpg"  alt="Landwehrkanal"  class="center"  />



<p>I went for a walk to the shops today, to pick up some supplies. I was looking
for ALDI - which is a discount supermarket - but ended up walking into Bauhaus
- which is the German equivalent of Bunnings. I wasn&rsquo;t sure how to walk out
without purchasing anything, so I looked around for something to buy so I could
leave. I browsed through a wide range of products including thermometers, paint
brushes and lamps but nothing stood out. I thought the staff might be getting
suspicious because it had been 20 minutes and I&rsquo;d started walking in circles, so
I just avoided eye contact and walked past the checkout and to the nearest
door as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find ALDI but I did find an organic food store - &ldquo;denn&rsquo;s Biomarkt&rdquo;.
It was a very nice store with everything lovingly laid out, and the friendly
man at the checkout was one of the jolliest people I had ever seen working in a
supermarket. I paid 2€ ($3.30 NZD) for a carton of oat milk, which isn&rsquo;t bad
considering this store must certainly be on the pricier side - Countdown are
selling a similar milk for $4.19. Groceries in Berlin are so cheap :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tidbit: shop.countdown.co.nz can&rsquo;t be directly accessed from Germany. You just
get an &ldquo;Access Denied&rdquo; server error.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Leaving the Biomarkt I found the entrance to ALDI and had a look inside.
It&rsquo;s like a small messy Pak&rsquo;n&rsquo;Save - I had difficulty finding anything I needed
and skipped outside.</p>

<p>The next store I visited was &ldquo;dm-drogerie markt&rdquo; - which had a lot of non-food
items available for sale and everything was nicely organized, both items on the
shelves and the aisles themselves. They had a great range of shaving products -
I&rsquo;m looking to buy some pre-shave cream, but I don&rsquo;t know what the German word
for that is yet&hellip;</p>

<p>The fourth supermarket I found was &ldquo;EDEKA Fiebig&rdquo;. All these stores are right
next to each other. This was the fanciest supermarket I had seen yet,
equivalent to a New World. They also had just about everything I needed, and it
was pretty easy to find my way around.</p>

<hr />

<p>Other than supermarkets I also visited the Uniqlo in Alexanderplatz.  They get
a decent rep on /r/malefashionadvice, and we don&rsquo;t have them in New Zealand. I
just wanted to buy a scarf (I lost my previous one in a taxi) and they had nice
checkered one on sale for 2.90€. The queue for the checkout was quite long, as
it&rsquo;s quite a popular store. I&rsquo;m quite proud of myself for understanding when
the woman asked me if I wanted a bag in German, even though I had to reply in
English.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m quickly learning how to purchase stuff at a store:</p>

<ol>
<li>Join the queue</li>
<li>When it&rsquo;s your turn, greet the cashier with &ldquo;hallo&rdquo; or &ldquo;guten Tag&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Wait for them to scan your items</li>
<li>Read the total cost from the monitor and give them enough cash to cover it</li>
<li>Wait for your change (I haven&rsquo;t figure out how to say &ldquo;Keep the change&rdquo; when
it&rsquo;s only 1 cent - I have a jar full of small change now)</li>
<li>They will ask if you want a &ldquo;kassenzettel&rdquo; which is the receipt - I usually
reply &ldquo;nein bitte&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Collect your items, say &ldquo;danke schön!&rdquo; and leave</li>
</ol>
