<p>The AirBnB I am staying in has a washing machine in the bathroom. The
Constructa Viva 1000 - a front loader. It&rsquo;s an older machine, the plastic has
started to yellow, the window is covered in a brown dust and the soap drawer
has something growing inside it. While the labels are all in German, someone
had thankfully scrawled on english translations with a marker, though most of
these had faded and were unreadable.</p>

<p>The machine door sits ajar, I pile in my laundry and try to shut the door. It
doesn&rsquo;t stay shut so I wiggle it a bit until it finally snaps closed with a
sharp click. I press the button marked &ldquo;Ein Aus&rdquo; (on/off) and swivel the
washing dial but nothing happens.  I try pressing more buttons and rotating the
other dials, but still the machine just sits there.  I begin to wonder if this
machine works at all, and decide it&rsquo;s probably best to wait until the host gets
back to ask him how to use it.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when I notice a lone sock still in my laundry bag - I had missed it
earlier. I pick it up and go to open the door to add it in. The door is quite
stiff, so I pull harder but still it doesn&rsquo;t open. I try wiggling it, and
pressing buttons, but the door remains locked tight. I try everything I can to
get the door open, though careful not to pull so hard that I risk damaging the
machine, but no luck. My shirts, socks and undies sit trapped inside as
prisoners of the machine.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m quite concerned at this point, as I start to realise that this machine may
be broken and I shouldn&rsquo;t be using it all. I quickly google for &ldquo;how to open
stuck washing machine door&rdquo; and find some YouTube videos suggesting I try to
disconnect the power and wait 5 minutes. So I disconnect the power and wait 5
minutes. The machine doesn&rsquo;t seem to notice.</p>

<p>I then google videos of people using the Constructa Viva 1000. Maybe there is
some sort of obvious trick to opening the door that I was overlooking.
Surprisingly, someone had actually filmed a Constructa Viva 1000 for over 15
minutes while it did a quick wash. I skipped straight to the end and watched as
they turned the machine off and then slid out the soap drawer before simply
opening the door. I thought aha! I need to slide out the soap drawer. So I rush
to the bathroom to try. The door stays locked.</p>

<p>I try again and again, pressing &ldquo;Ein Aus&rdquo; for the millionth time, rotating all
the doors to all possible positions and yanking on the door. I slid the down in
and out, and then suddenly the machine whirs into action, and my clothes start
spinning around in circles. This is a great sign, because it means the machine
isn&rsquo;t broken and that I will at least have clean clothes. I configure the
machine to do a short wash, and leave it while I make dinner.</p>

<p>After dinner, I return to the machine, confident that now it has finished it&rsquo;s
duty, the door will be unlocked and can I hang out my clothes. I try to the
open door again, and nope, still locked tight. I examine the latch closely, but
can&rsquo;t see any way of opening it without potentially damaging the machine. I
decide the best thing to do is to wait for the host to return, surely he will
know how to open it and we will have a laugh about how silly I&rsquo;ve been. Surely.</p>

<p>It was 10pm, and my host still hadn&rsquo;t returned, so I headed to bed. In the
morning, I walked into the bathroom and noticed three things.</p>

<ol>
<li>The Washing Machine door was open</li>
<li>All my clothes had been strung out on the clothes horse</li>
<li>There is a metal knife sitting on the window sill directly to the right of
the washing machine. I hadn&rsquo;t noticed this knife before, but I imagine it&rsquo;s
crucial to getting to the door open.</li>
</ol>
