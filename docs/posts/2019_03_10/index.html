<p>After today I will have been in Berlin for one week.</p>

<p>I packed my bags and checked out of my first AirBnB at 11am, and can check in
to my next AirBnB at 3pm.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a cold day, but I have my scarf, jersey and jacket so I&rsquo;ll be fine. I can
visit a cafe while I pass the time.</p>

<p>However, today is Sonntag (Sunday). What I had forgotten about Berlin is that
today most of the shops are closed, including cafes. They take the day of rest
seriously here.</p>

<p>So I wandered around for a bit and after a while found a good place to sit by
the canal. One thing I miss about small English towns is the sheer abundance of
benches.</p>

<p>This was fine until it started to rain down. I found a cafe in Kreuzberg that
was open, simply called &ldquo;Cafe &amp; bäckerei&rdquo;. They served Turkish tea and tasty
baguettes. This was my first time ordering at a cafe by myself, and it went
pretty well, even though they had to pour my tea again because someone else
claimed the first one.</p>

<p>I tried to do some work on
<a href="https://github.com/stayradiated/plextools">plextools</a> but for some reason my
Vodafone UK sim doesn&rsquo;t seem to let me tether it to my laptop, which is a bit
of a shame. I&rsquo;ll need to pick up a German SIM card sometime this month.</p>

<p>I checked in to my week 2 AirBnB and met Pietro and his cats Klaus and Franz.
His cats are very friendly but are also very smart. I didn&rsquo;t believe it when
Pietro said they could open doors (by jumping and grabbing the handle!), but
I&rsquo;ve witnessed it a few times now. This means if I want to keep my room cat
free I need to lock my door - luckily they haven&rsquo;t figured out how to use the
key yet.</p>

<p>For dinner I made pasta with pesto and cheese again. This is the fifth time in
the past seven days that I&rsquo;ve had pasta with pesto and cheese for dinner. I
really need to try something new tomorrow.</p>

<p>The lounge/kitchen in this AirBnB is very spacious.</p>
