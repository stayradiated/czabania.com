      <p>Trying out a new blog format, where I just jot down notes about what I did
today. It&rsquo;s inspired by <a href="https://alicebartlett.co.uk/">the wonderful blog of Alice
Bartlett</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I enjoy bumping into friends while walking around town. I used to get really
anxious if I saw someone I recognised, and would go out of my way to make
sure they didn&rsquo;t see me. I&rsquo;ve since lived in enough cities where I would know
no-one, so now I enjoy seeing a familiar face and having a chat.</p></li>

<li><p>Trying to pick a city to live in is difficult. I like living in Berlin
because out of all the cities in Europe, it&rsquo;s where I know the most people.</p></li>

<li><p>I listened to the latest episode of 99% Invisible, featuring an episode
of John Green&rsquo;s podcast <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/anthropocene-reviewed">&ldquo;The Anthropocene
Reviewed&rdquo;</a>, where he
reviews all sorts of things, such as supermakets, comets and the Tacobell
menu. I like the way John talks about everything. I think about if I could
write my own review, and what it would be about.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve just moved into my own apartment, so I can start cooking again! I&rsquo;m
trying out &ldquo;budgetbytes.com&rdquo; for recipes, and so far so good. For dinner I
made <a href="https://www.budgetbytes.com/spicy-coconut-vegetable-stir-fry/">Spicy Coconut Vegetable Stir
Fry</a> which was
quite easy to prepare, and pretty tasty. It also made enough for tomorrow for
lunch tomorrow. Afterwards I tried to make <a href="https://www.budgetbytes.com/luscious-homemade-lemon-curd/">Luscious Homemade Lemon
Curd</a> - which I
accidentally mixed in the butter with the other ingredients, rather than
adding the butter later. I hope it still turns out ok - it&rsquo;s currently
cooling off in the fridge. Tomorrow I  will make <a href="https://www.budgetbytes.com/lemon-berry-yogurt-breakfast-bowls/">Lemon Berry Yogurt
Breakfast
Bowls</a> for
breakfast.</p></li>

<li><p>When I&rsquo;m living by myself, I find I have far more free time. I&rsquo;m trying to
let myself get bored, instead of turning to HN and Reddit. I think being
bored is part of the creative process.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven&rsquo;t been keeping track of what I&rsquo;ve been up to over the last few
months, so I am trying to write down daily todo lists. Ticking things off is
a good feeling.</p></li>

<li><p>I visited a lot of supermarkets trying to find regular Peanut Butter. The
first three I tried only had Nutella! I eventually visited the fancy
expensive supermarkrt, which fortunately had &ldquo;Erdnussbutter&rdquo; - but just the
one option. I miss the wide variety of peanut butters available in New
Zealand, there was a whole section dedicated to them.</p></li>
