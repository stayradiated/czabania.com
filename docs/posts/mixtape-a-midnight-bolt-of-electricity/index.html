<p>Continuing to redub my mixtape collection, today I chose one of my favourite
mixes - &ldquo;A Midnight Bolt of Electricity&rdquo; - for times when you just need some
banging tunes.</p>

<p>This is the first cassette that I used the calibration feature to set the bias
and recording level. I also checked the left/right balance by using a signal
generator app to make sure that both channels were equal. The end result is
that this is the best sounding cassette I have recorded to date. I should also
point out that I am using Type I cassettes - which are the least expensive and
have the most noise. I also happen to have a whole heap of them.</p>

<p>The tracks for this mixtape have changed - I must have recorded a different
track on side B because when my playlist finished I still had nearly 3 minutes
of tape left. So I added SALES - Chinese New Year because it&rsquo;s a great song and
the perfect length.</p>
