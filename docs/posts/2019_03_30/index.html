      <p>I finally bought a pair of running shoes in Berlin today. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve
been meaning to do since I got here nearly a month ago, but I&rsquo;ve never seemed
to have the time. Last weekend I made my way to &ldquo;Lunge der Laufladen&rdquo;, but only
had 10 minutes before they closed, which wasn&rsquo;t nearly enough time to pick out
a pair of shoes. This afternoon I returned just after midday, and tried out
several different types of shoe.</p>

<p>I quite like the Nike LunarGlide 8 shoes - I owned a pair back in New Zealand
and found them to be quite comfortable, lightweight and stable. It has since
been replaced by the Nike LunarGlide 9, but unfortunately Nike don&rsquo;t seem to be
making them any more. The running shop had some old stock, but not in my size.</p>

<p>However, there is the Nike LunarGlide 8 Shield - which is pretty much the same
shoe except it has a different colour scheme and has a water-repellent top bit.
They cost me 90€ (~ $150) which is pretty pricey, but I expect that they will last
me a good 400km or so.</p>

<p>I went for a run shortly after, my first in over a month! It felt great to get
some proper outdoor exercise, especially today as the sun was shining bright
and there were few clouds to be seen.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently staying in Lankwitz, which is right at the south border of
Berlin. It&rsquo;s very flat (like most of Berlin) and I just ran along the concrete
footpath, following the main road south. I actually ended up leaving Berlin,
and entered into Brandenburg, which is the state that surrounds Berlin.</p>

<p>I normally run around 8 - 10km, but decided since it had been a while, and
these are new shoes I shouldn&rsquo;t overdo it, so today I ran only 6.6km. I did
keep up a decent pace of 4:03/km. Tomorrow I plan to go for a morning run, this
time heading north and through the gorgeous community park.</p>
