      <description>One of my goals for 2017 is to take an instant film photograph every single day.
Yesterday I had lunch at one of my favourite places in Mt Eden - on the actual mountain bit, not the suburb. As I was leaving I captured this photo of myself walking up a hill.
I hung the camera in a nearby tree and set the timer before rushing back to get in position.</description>

      <description>I woke up a cold this morning - and went out for a walk listening to my &amp;lsquo;Sick Days&amp;rsquo; mixtape I made the last time I had a cold. I decided to make a new mixtape for when I was feeling under the weather. It&amp;rsquo;s mainly based around some artists I have been listening to a lot lately.
Spotify Playlist:
 Cassette List:
Side A
 Earl St. Clair - Good Time Yukno - Sonne Portugal.</description>
