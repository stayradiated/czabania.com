      <p>I&rsquo;ve had a cold for the last couple of days and have been stuck inside with
chicken noodle soup, lemon+honey drinks and a nose that doesn&rsquo;t seem to stop
sneezing - I considered trying for the world record of longest sneezing fit
but <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/67595-longest-sneezing-fit">the current world record is 977 days!</a></p>

<p>Instead I decided to venture outside for some fresh air, and ended up
finding a hidden path to get up the side of Mt Eden and into Tahaki Reserve.</p>

<p>I decided to get some photos of how I setup the instant film camera -
because sometimes the setup can be quite interesting to see.</p>

<p>Note that I am quite weary of the camera falling too it&rsquo;s peril - so I have
attached the strap to a nearby plant.</p>

<p>I had to be quite careful where I stepped as the grass was a little wet and it
was quite a steep drop below the rocks.</p>

<p>I am using the Manfrotto Pixi Mini tripod - which is perfect for this camera.</p>
