            Trying out a new blog format, where I just jot down notes about what I did today. It&rsquo;s inspired by the wonderful blog of Alice Bartlett.
 I enjoy bumping into friends while walking around town. I used to get really anxious if I saw someone I recognised, and would go out of my way to make sure they didn&rsquo;t see me. I&rsquo;ve since lived in enough cities where I would know no-one, so now I enjoy seeing a familiar face and having a chat.

            I had a goal at the start of the year to regularly post to my blog.
I haven&rsquo;t posted to my blog in a while, and every day I don&rsquo;t I feel a little bit more worse about it, and so I end up just kind of ignoring it more.
But not today.
Completing goals feels good, especially if you keep a checklist and tick items off when you are done.

            I moved into my new apartment on Monday. It&rsquo;s a cute little place - I&rsquo;m renting it for a month through Wunderflats. It has a pretty neat kitchen, so I&rsquo;m planning to do a lot of cooking while I&rsquo;m here.
My new kitchen!  I made pizza for dinner last night, and it turned it really well so I made it again tonight. For the bases I&rsquo;ve been using this Homemad Thin-Crust Pizza recipe, which I really like because it&rsquo;s quick, easy and tastes pretty good.

            I finally bought a pair of running shoes in Berlin today. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve been meaning to do since I got here nearly a month ago, but I&rsquo;ve never seemed to have the time. Last weekend I made my way to &ldquo;Lunge der Laufladen&rdquo;, but only had 10 minutes before they closed, which wasn&rsquo;t nearly enough time to pick out a pair of shoes. This afternoon I returned just after midday, and tried out several different types of shoe.

            Tomorrow my Vodafone UK prepaid SIM card plan expires. It&rsquo;s a bit of a shame, because I still have a whopping 15.7 GB of data left on it. I would have liked to have used that data, but unfortunately for some reason I can&rsquo;t tether it to my laptop - which is a show stopper.
I&rsquo;ve done a bit of research looking for the best prepaid plan in Germany. I think ALDI Talk&rsquo;s Paket M is the best plan for me - at 12.
