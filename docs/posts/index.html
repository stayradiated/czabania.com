				Saturday morning. I decided to bake a batch of bagels. This is the second time I&rsquo;ve ever made bagels - the first I tried two different styles: San Francisco and New York. This time I just made the New York style.

It&rsquo;s really not that difficult to make bagels, though it is time consuming, as you need to wait a good hour and a half while the dough rises.

				This was a late night cooking experiment. Originally I wanted to make some bagels - but I didn&rsquo;t have enough flour. A friend suggested I make this Ginger Crunch recipe instead - and it turned out pretty well.

				Continuing to redub my mixtape collection, today I chose one of my favourite mixes - &ldquo;A Midnight Bolt of Electricity&rdquo; - for times when you just need some banging tunes.
This is the first cassette that I used the calibration feature to set the bias and recording level. I also checked the left/right balance by using a signal generator app to make sure that both channels were equal. The end result is that this is the best sounding cassette I have recorded to date.

				Today I purchased my third cassette deck from Fred at retrotronics.co.nz. This one is a Sony TC-K615S and it&rsquo;s an absolute beast of a machine. I chose it because it it is a 3-head cassette deck, that is in excellent condition and supports bias calibration. I&rsquo;ll probably write a blog post about it sometime soon.
Anyway, the important thing is that the tapes I record with it sound a lot better than recordings I have made with my other decks.

				I&rsquo;ve had a cold for the last couple of days and have been stuck inside with chicken noodle soup, lemon+honey drinks and a nose that doesn&rsquo;t seem to stop sneezing - I considered trying for the world record of longest sneezing fit but the current world record is 977 days!
Instead I decided to venture outside for some fresh air, and ended up finding a hidden path to get up the side of Mt Eden and into Tahaki Reserve.

				I quite like cassette tapes - particularly recording mixtapes.
I acquired a 1970&rsquo;s Sony cassette deck earlier this year - I chose this one because of it&rsquo;s gorgeous wooden plinth and top-loading cassette tray.
It plays back fine, and sounds pretty good for it&rsquo;s age.
However, earlier today, the play button stopped working - I physically couldn&rsquo;t depress the switch anymore. I removed the top and bottom covers to reveal the complex inner workings.

				One of my goals for 2017 is to take an instant film photograph every single day.
Yesterday I had lunch at one of my favourite places in Mt Eden - on the actual mountain bit, not the suburb. As I was leaving I captured this photo of myself walking up a hill.
I hung the camera in a nearby tree and set the timer before rushing back to get in position.

				I woke up a cold this morning - and went out for a walk listening to my &lsquo;Sick Days&rsquo; mixtape I made the last time I had a cold. I decided to make a new mixtape for when I was feeling under the weather. It&rsquo;s mainly based around some artists I have been listening to a lot lately.
