    <div class="post-content">
      <p>Yesterday I started a new project.</p>

<p>Quick background:</p>

<ol>
<li>At Mish Guru we use Github to manage our code.</li>
<li>When a developer wants to submit a change, such as adding a feature or
fixing a bug, they create a Pull Request (PR).</li>
<li>This PR has a title, description of why the change was made and a list of
all the files that were edited.</li>
<li>Before the PR can be accepted, it must first be reviewed by at least one
other member of the team.</li>
<li>Each day several PRs will be created, some are small changes and don&rsquo;t take
very long to review, others can be quite large and may require a bit of
back-and-forth before they are accepted.</li>
</ol>

<p>Cool. So, we have all these PRs, and we need a way to keep track of
them all. We currently use <a href="https://github.com/binaryberry/seal">Seal</a> - which
does a pretty good job of posting a list of all open PRs on Slack.</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="/img/2019_03_16_seal.jpg"  alt="Seal"   />
    
      <figcaption class="center" >Seal</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>However, it could be better.</p>

<ul>
<li>All PRs are listed in a single slack post. This makes it difficult to comment
on a particular PR. We also can&rsquo;t check off each PR as we review it.</li>
<li>We use Clubhouse at Mish to keep track of what we are working on, and each PR
should be linked to a Clubhouse card. It would be useful if we could get that
link displayed in Slack, and also highlight which PRs haven&rsquo;t been linked.</li>
<li>The person who opened the PR is displayed, but Seal shows their github
username. At Mish we usually refer to each by our real names. E.g. I would
like &ldquo;George Czabania&rdquo; displayed instead of &ldquo;stayradiated&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Support for custom validation checks. We want to encourage team members to
write a description for their PR, but it can be easy to forget. If
a PR is missing a description, then it should encourage them to write one.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I started a new project called &ldquo;Git Guru&rdquo;. It uses the Github REST API to
fetch all the open pull requests, and formats the data as a pretty nice looking
Slack attachment.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all open source and you can find the repo at
<a href="https://github.com/mishguruorg/gitguru">https://github.com/mishguruorg/gitguru</a></p>
